# Advanced Databases

This repo contains my project from the course "Advanced Databases". I attended the course during 2019-2020 in the National Technical University of Athens, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

For the implementation we used technologies such as Spark.
The approach I used is based on the map-reduce logic we discussed during the courses.
